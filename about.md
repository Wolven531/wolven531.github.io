Hi! 👋 My name is Anthony. According to my GitHub profile:

> I am a versatile software engineer with a passion for using technology to enrich people's lives.

That about sums me up pretty accurately. 👍 Basically, you can find me doing one of three things:

* Hanging out with my amazing son, Oliver 👶
* Hanging out with my wonderful fiancé, Nicole 💃
* Coding 💻

### Additionally

Our family also includes five dogs 🐶 and three cats 🐱.

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Anthony. According to my GitHub profile:

> I am a versatile software engineer with a passion for using technology to enrich people's lives.

That about sums me up pretty accurately. Basically, you can find me doing one of three things:

* Hanging out with my amazing son, Oliver ðŸ‘¶
* Hanging out with my wonderful fiancÃ©, Nicole ðŸ’ƒ
* Coding ðŸ’»

### Additionally

Our family also includes four dogs (Misty, Faith, Larry, and Fifi) and two cats (Dio and Cloud). We all like to get together and binge watch Netflix and YouTube.

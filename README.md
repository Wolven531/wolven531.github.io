## Local Development

1. Install Jekyll and plugins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
1. Clone down your fork `git clone https://github.com/wolven531/wolven531.github.io.git`
1. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
1. View your website at [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/)
1. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website

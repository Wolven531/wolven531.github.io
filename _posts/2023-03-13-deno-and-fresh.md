I've been playing around w/ [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) and [Deno](https://deno.land/) recently. I've thoroughly enjoyed the first class TypeScript support provided by Deno, and Fresh's decision to go all in on [islands architecture](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/islands-architecture) demonstrates why the framework's name is so fitting. Currently, I'm playing around w/ several live sites - [this one](https://wolven531-ajw-fresh.deno.dev) connects w/ MongoDB and features GraphQL and [this one](https://wolven531-ajw-fresh.deno.dev) does some number crunching (each deployed using [Deno deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)). Given the years of experience I have w/ [React](https://reactjs.org), I have also enjoyed utilizing [preact](https://preactjs.com) and learning about the differences between its lightweight approach and React's full lifecycle.

I'm hopeful as the technology continues to evolve, novel and simple approaches like this continue to become the norm, rather than the oddity as they make better engineering patterns accessible to more engineers and eliminate entire categories of common software issues.
